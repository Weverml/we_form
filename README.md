WI Form Project

My project is a system aimed at registering entities dedicated to helping animals and individuals in vulnerable situations.  

Users need to provide essential information such as the name of the organization, its area of operation, and the collection point.

The user has the option to register a new field of action if the desired area for the entity is not in the system, and the user can also have access to entities already registered.
